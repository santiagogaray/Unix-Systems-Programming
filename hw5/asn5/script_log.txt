        Test 1: Does the program read commands from a script?
                OK
        Test 2: Does cd work correctly?
                /tmp
/tmp
cd works when the directory exists
                /bad.directory: No such file or directory.
cd detects bad directories
        Test 3: Does the shell do variable substitution correctly?
                and ignore dollar signs when asked?
                OK
        Test 4: Does the shell read in variables correctly?
                OK
        Test 5a: Does the if command work?
                OK
        Test 5b: Does the if detect missing thens ?
                error: unexpected else statement.
OK
        Test 5c: Does the if command find unexpected EOFS?
                root:*:0:1:system PRIVILEGED account:/:/bin/sh
this system has a root login
that is a good thing
error: unexpected EOF
OK
        Test 5d: Does the if catch missing ifs?
                root:*:0:1:system PRIVILEGED account:/:/bin/sh
this system has a root login
that is a good thing
something is wrong here
there is no login for root
error: unexpected then statement.
error: unexpected else statement.
error: unexpected fi statement.
OK
        Test 6: Does the shell process the exit built-in ok?
                OK
        Test 7: A manual test

        Does your shell reject assignment statements of the
        form
                9xyz=tuna
        or      x.y=fun

         That is, assignments to names that are not legal
        variable identifiers
