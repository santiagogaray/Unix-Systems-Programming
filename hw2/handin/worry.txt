Things to worry about:

In my version only one file is opened at the same time.
A buffer that holds each possible directory found.
Once the directory is completely listed it is closed.
Then the function starts its recursive loop with each of
the direcories stored. Maybe a possible bug in my program
(between others) could raise from run-outs of memory in
large directories, but it's seemed to work pretty well at
least in the /usr one.
